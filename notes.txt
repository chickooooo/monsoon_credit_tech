For starters, you can just run the '/notebooks/10_making_prediction.ipynb' notebook to make predictions.

If you want to test the model on a different dataset, just replace the file_path of `x_test`
in the above notebook. (Make sure the new data has same structure as the old data)


If you want more details, you can refer to individual data pipeline scripts in '/scripts/pipelines'
folder. All the tasks performed in these scripts are explained in the respective notebooks in '/notebooks' folder.


This project is also thoroughly documented and comments are added at necessary places.


At last, the score achieved was 0.755. So the test score is expected to be around this number.
